    "- Array problems often have simple brute-force solutions that have $O(n)$ space complexity, but subtler solutions use the array itself to reduce space complexity to $O(1)$.\n",

    "- Instead of deleting an entry (which requires moving all entries to its right), consider overwriting it with a tombstone.\n",
    "- Be comfortable with writing code that operates on subarrays.\n",
    "- Don't worry about preserving the integrity of the array (sortedness, etc...) until it's time to return.\n",
    "- A one-pass, range query algorithm can be generalized with *start*, *current*, and *end* indices of which each index is updated per cases qualifying the range.\n",

    "- Although for a sufficiently large $n$, $O(\\log{n}) \\ll O(\\sqrt{n})$, for $n \\le 10^6$, in practice, $O(\\log{n}) \\approx O(\\sqrt{n})$ because of the physical overhead of conditionally executing the recurrence-tree, lower bound of an $O(\\log{n})$ process.\n",
