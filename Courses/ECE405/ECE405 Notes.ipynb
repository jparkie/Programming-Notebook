    "3. Because the magnetic field gradient is in the $z$-direction, the force is perpendicular to the direction of motion and deflects the beam in proportion to the component of the magnetic moment in the direction of the magnetic field gradient.\n",
    "4. A charged particle in an atom has an **orbital angular momentum** $L$ and an **intrinsic angular momentum**, **spin**, $S$.\n",

    "6. Thus, the deflection of the beam in the Stern-Gerlach experiment is a measure of the component $S_{z}$ of the spin along the $z$-axis, which is the orientation of the magnetic field gradient.\n",
    "    - **Classical**: A continuous distribution of spin components from $-\\lvert \\mathbf{S} \\rvert$ to $+\\lvert \\mathbf{S} \\rvert$ was expected to be observed.\n",
    "    - **Quantum**: A discrete distribution of spin components $S_{z} = \\pm \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ was actually observed.\n",
    "        - where $\\hbar = 6.5821 \\times 10^{-16} eV \\cdot s$ is Planck's constant $h$ divided by $2\\pi$.\n",
